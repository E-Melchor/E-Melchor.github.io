When I applied to UH Manoa, my plan was to be an elementary education major. That all changed after working at an afterschool program with elementary school kids. These kids are fun but can be quite challenging when it comes to getting homework done, especially with the rascal ones. I soon realized that education was not the major for me.
After changing majors a couple times, I finally settled with accounting. There are three main reasons: 1) it’s a steady career field, 2) it’s a major where you develop useful hard and soft skills, and 3) it’s interesting enough that I'll stick with it. 
Last semester I took BUS 209 (business writing), and I found out that my professor is also CPA certified. I joined his office hours to ask some questions about his general thoughts about the accounting field and any advice on double majoring, since I was toying with the idea of studying either finance or MIS. He strongly recommended MIS, since the two subjects compliment each other well. After doing some additional research online, I decided to register for ITM 352 and start diving into the MIS field.
