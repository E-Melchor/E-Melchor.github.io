After reading through the instructions for Browser History  1, I thought it would be easy to complete within the Sd time (20 to 25 minutes) on the first try. Instead, I was still working on step 5 when my 25 minute timer went off. What slowed me down was trying to remember little details, like using the href attribute to make links instead of src. Before trying again, I reviewed the module readings (specifically the parts that I was having a hard time recalling during the WOD). Reviewing definitely helped because my second attempt took 17 minutes. Although I completed within the Av time, I wanted to try again to clean up my screencast, which showed me hopping all over the place between VS Code, timer, and my notes. My last attempt ended up being just under 12 minutes.
